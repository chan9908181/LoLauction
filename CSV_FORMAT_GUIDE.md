## ‚ùå Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **Wrong Header Format:**
```csv
‚ùå Player Name,Skill Level,Bio,Role
‚ùå name,tier,description,position
‚ùå Name;Tier;Description;Position
```

### **Wrong Position Values:**
```csv
‚ùå "Faker","S","Mid lane player","Mid"
‚ùå "Canyon","S","Jungle player","Jungle"
‚ùå "Khan","A","Top player","Top Laner"
```

### **Wrong Tier Values:**
```csv
‚ùå "Faker","Master Tier","Mid lane player","MID"  (use "Master" not "Master Tier")
‚ùå "Canyon","rank 1","Jungle player","JGL"        (use proper rank name)
‚ùå "Khan","high elo","Top player","TOP"           (be specific with rank)
```

## üîß CSV Formatting Rules

### **1. Encoding**
- Use UTF-8 encoding
- Save as `.csv` file extension

### **2. Delimiters**
- Use comma (`,`) as field separator
- Use double quotes (`"`) around each field
- Use newline (`\n`) for row separation

### **3. Special Characters**
- If description contains commas, wrap in quotes: `"Player with high damage, good positioning"`
- If description contains quotes, escape them: `"Player known as ""The King"""`
- Avoid special characters in names: `‚úÖ "T1_Faker"` `‚ùå "T1#Faker"`

### **4. Data Validation**
- No empty rows between data
- No empty fields (all 4 columns must have values)
- Consistent position naming across all rows
